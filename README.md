# Lumerical-Code

# First file is for use in Lumerical in order to simulate the junction and find the transmission at each terminal. Remember to update this file whenever you update the parameters
#
# Second file is used to create an assembly of junctions on MATLAB. Calculations are mostly done in matrices and should not require much editing if junctions parameters are changed.
